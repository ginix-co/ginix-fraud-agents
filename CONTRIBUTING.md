## Submitting Your Contribution

### Writing Code

- Please follow our [style guide](style-guide-link), including proper documentation, meaningful variable names, and well-structured code.
- Ensure your code is tested before submitting. We strive for high-quality, reliable agents.
- For machine learning agents, clearly describe the model, data, and performance metrics in your pull request.

### Pull Request Process

1. When you submit a pull request, ensure it is linked to an open issue (if applicable) and includes a clear description of what the contribution does.
2. Your pull request will be reviewed by one or more maintainers. We may ask questions or request changes before merging.
3. Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the repository.

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- Ensure all functions and classes are documented with clear docstrings.
  
### Fraud Detection Agent Guidelines
- **Rule-based Agents**: Clearly outline the rules used for fraud detection in both the code and the documentation.
- **Machine Learning Agents**: Include a brief description of the model and dataset. Ensure any trained models or datasets are included or linked to for reproducibility.
